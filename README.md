# Excel-based Automation for Import Rate Comparison

This project was developed as part of my Advanced Diploma in Supply Chain Management and my BSc in Management Engineering.

During my internship, I designed and implemented an Excel-based automation tool to streamline the comparison of maritime import rates. The solution was used by both the pricing and sales departments to reduce time consumption, manual workload, and human errors during quotation preparation.

## Problem
The manual comparison of import rates across multiple shipping companies was time-consuming, error-prone, and poorly standardized, especially under tight commercial deadlines.

## Solution
I developed an Excel tool that automatically retrieves import rates based on:
- shipping company,
- container type,
- destination zone.

The tool also computes the final customer quotation by applying the company’s profit margin.

## Key Features
- Automated rate retrieval using Excel formulas (VLOOKUP, MATCH, IF)
- Dropdown menus with data validation
- Conditional formatting for clarity and error prevention
- Protected cells to ensure data integrity and usability

## Data
To preserve confidentiality, shipping companies were anonymized (A, B, C) and rate values were simulated using the `RAND.BETWEEN` function.

## Validation and Impact
The tool was tested against the existing manual procedure, validated by operational staff, and integrated into daily workflows.  
It led to significant improvements in:
- processing speed,
- standardization,
- reliability of quotations.

## Skills & Tools
- Microsoft Excel (advanced formulas, data validation, automation)
- Process optimization
- Lean and efficiency-oriented design
